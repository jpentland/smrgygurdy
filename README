To view the documentation go to 
doc/index.html

To build for the first time from source, do:

	./autogen.sh
	./configure

Say ./configure --help to list configuration options.

The smrgygurdy program will be built in the src directory.

The following libraries need to be installed first:

	artifastring
	libusb (if configured to use the MiniLAB HID)
	libhid (if configured to use the MiniLAB HID)
        comedilib (if configured to use comedi devices - default)
        bogiolib (https://github.com/nickbailey/bogiolib -
                  a wrapper to simplify access to comedilib)

libhid is distributed in the tar file in the top level of this
package, for convenience.

You'll need a valid configuration file to run this program.
An example is given in smrgygurdy.conf. You can copy this into /etc
or to $HOME/.smrgygurdy as takes your fancy. smrgygurdy writes
the current configuration to the latter on exiting via the
q command.
